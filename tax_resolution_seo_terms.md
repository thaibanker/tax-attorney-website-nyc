## üìä TASK TRACKING INTEGRATION

**Log File**: `task_completion_log.json`
**Agent Instructions**: 
- Read log before starting any task
- Update log immediately after completing each page
- Track time, quality, and conversion elements
- Note any issues or optimizations needed

---

*This plan serves as the master blueprint for creating a high-converting tax resolution website.*
```

## File 2: `task_completion_log.json`

```json
<code_block_to_apply_changes_from>
```

## Next Steps:

1. **Create these two files** in your project directory
2. **Set up your agent** to read the `task_completion_log.json` before starting any task
3. **Begin with Page 1** using the Perplexity MCP command:

```bash
perplexity_ask "Create a high-converting landing page for 'Emergency Tax Attorney NYC' targeting people in NYC who are in tax crisis. [Use full template from plan file]"
```

4. **After each page completion**, update the log file with:
   - Completion status
   - Quality metrics
   - Any issues encountered
   - Next steps

The agent will be able to track progress, maintain consistency, and ensure all 30 pages follow the same high-converting structure while addressing the specific crisis situations that drive immediate action from people who owe money to tax authorities.
