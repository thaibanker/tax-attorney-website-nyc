## ‚ùì **URGENT HARDSHIP QUESTIONS - ANSWERED NOW**

### **Q: How quickly can IRS collections be stopped for hardship?**
**A:** Collections can be stopped within 24 hours through emergency hardship declarations. We file protective measures immediately while CNC status is being processed.

### **Q: How long does Currently Not Collectible status last?**
**A:** CNC status typically lasts 1-3 years, with annual reviews. If your financial situation improves significantly, the IRS may resume collections.

### **Q: Will CNC status hurt my credit score?**
**A:** CNC status itself doesn't hurt credit, but existing tax liens remain. However, no new collection actions occur, preventing further credit damage.

### **Q: Can I work while in Currently Not Collectible status?**
**A:** Yes. You can work and earn income, but it must still leave you unable to pay both necessary living expenses and the tax debt.

### **Q: What if my financial situation improves?**
**A:** You're required to contact the IRS if your income increases significantly. However, temporary improvements don't automatically end CNC status.

### **Q: Can business owners qualify for Currently Not Collectible?**
**A:** Yes. Business owners can qualify if the business income, after necessary business expenses, leaves insufficient funds for personal living expenses and tax debt.

### **Q: What happens to penalties and interest during CNC status?**
**A:** Penalties and interest continue to accrue during CNC status, but no collection actions occur. We often negotiate penalty abatement separately.
