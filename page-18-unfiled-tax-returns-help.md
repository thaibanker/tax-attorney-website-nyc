## ‚ùì **URGENT UNFILED RETURN QUESTIONS - ANSWERED NOW**

### **Q: Will I go to jail for not filing tax returns?**
**A:** Criminal prosecution is rare but possible for willful non-filing. Voluntary filing with professional representation almost always prevents criminal charges.

### **Q: What if I don't have my W-2s or 1099s from years ago?**
**A:** We can obtain wage and income transcripts directly from the IRS, reconstruct records from bank statements, and work with employers to recreate documentation.

### **Q: How far back do I need to file?**
**A:** The IRS typically requires 6 years of back filing for compliance. However, we often recommend filing only years you owe money to minimize exposure.

### **Q: What if I can't afford to pay the taxes I'll owe?**
**A:** Filing and paying are separate issues. You must file to avoid criminal prosecution, but payment plans and other relief options are available for the debt.

### **Q: Should I file all years at once or one at a time?**
**A:** We use strategic sequential filing to minimize penalties and optimize refunds. Filing order can save thousands in penalties and interest.

### **Q: What if the IRS already filed substitute returns for me?**
**A:** Substitute returns include no deductions and maximum penalties. Filing your actual returns almost always results in lower taxes owed.

### **Q: Can I get refunds for old years I didn't file?**
**A:** Yes, but only if you file within 3 years of the due date. After 3 years, refunds are permanently lost to the government.
