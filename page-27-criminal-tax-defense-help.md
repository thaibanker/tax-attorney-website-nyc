## ‚ùì **CRIMINAL TAX DEFENSE QUESTIONS - ANSWERED BY EXPERTS**

### **Q: How do I know if I'm under criminal investigation?**
**A:** Signs include IRS-CI agents visiting, federal search warrants, subpoenas to third parties, or receiving IRS Letter 2205 (criminal investigation notification).

### **Q: What should I do if IRS agents come to my door?**
**A:** Politely decline to speak without an attorney present, provide your attorney's contact information, and call us immediately. Do not answer any questions.

### **Q: Can criminal tax cases be resolved without prosecution?**
**A:** Yes. Most criminal investigations can be resolved through civil settlement if handled properly with experienced criminal defense representation.

### **Q: What's the difference between civil and criminal tax cases?**
**A:** Civil cases seek money owed. Criminal cases seek prosecution and imprisonment. Criminal cases require proof beyond reasonable doubt of willful behavior.

### **Q: How long do criminal tax investigations take?**
**A:** IRS-CI investigations typically take 18-36 months. DOJ prosecution decisions usually occur within 6-12 months after IRS-CI completes investigation.

### **Q: Can I go to jail for tax problems?**
**A:** Yes, but only if criminally prosecuted and convicted. With proper defense, most tax problems can be resolved civilly without any jail time.

### **Q: What if I'm guilty of tax crimes?**
**A:** Being guilty doesn't mean prosecution is inevitable. Experienced defense can often negotiate civil resolution even in clear violation cases.
