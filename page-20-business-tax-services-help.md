## ‚ùì **URGENT BUSINESS TAX QUESTIONS - ANSWERED NOW**

### **Q: Can the IRS shut down my business for tax debt?**
**A:** Yes. The IRS has broad powers to seize business assets, close operations, and liquidate businesses for unpaid taxes, especially payroll taxes.

### **Q: Am I personally liable for my business's tax debt?**
**A:** It depends on entity type and tax type. Corporate officers are personally liable for payroll taxes (Trust Fund Recovery Penalty) regardless of business structure.

### **Q: How quickly can the IRS close my business?**
**A:** The IRS can seize business assets and shut operations within 30 days of demand for payment, sometimes faster for payroll tax debts.

### **Q: Can I get a payment plan for business tax debt?**
**A:** Yes. Business installment agreements are available, but require current compliance with all ongoing tax obligations (payroll, estimated taxes, etc.).

### **Q: What if my business can't afford current taxes while paying old debt?**
**A:** Businesses must stay current on ongoing obligations while paying old debt. We help structure cash flow to maintain operations and compliance.

### **Q: Should I close my business to avoid tax debt?**
**A:** Closing doesn't eliminate personal liability for payroll taxes. Often keeping the business open and negotiating resolution is better for everyone.

### **Q: How do business tax problems affect my personal finances?**
**A:** Business tax debts can result in personal liability, asset seizure, and credit damage, especially for payroll tax debts and personal guarantees.
