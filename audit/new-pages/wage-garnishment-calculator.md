### Understanding Wage Garnishment Limits (160 words)

The IRS can garnish your wages, but federal law protects a portion of your income. The amount protected depends on your filing status, number of dependents, and income level. For federal tax garnishments, the IRS follows Publication 1494 guidelines, which protect more income than typical debt garnishments.

**Federal Protection Standards:**
- Single filers: Minimum $445 weekly protection (2025)
- Married filing jointly: Up to $890 weekly protection
- Additional protection: $196 per dependent
- State variations: NY, NJ, CT may offer additional protections

The garnishment calculator shows exactly how much of your paycheck is protected and what you can expect to take home after garnishment begins. If your income is below federal poverty guidelines, you may qualify for full protection through economic hardship provisions.

Understanding these protections helps you make informed decisions about stopping garnishment versus negotiating payment plans.
