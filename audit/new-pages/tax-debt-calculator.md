### Debt Relief Options Analysis (150 words)

**Offer in Compromise (OIC)**
Settle your tax debt for less than the full amount owed. The IRS accepts OIC applications based on your ability to pay, income, expenses, and asset equity. Our calculator analyzes your financial situation to determine if you qualify and estimates your potential settlement amount.

**Installment Agreements**
Spread your tax payments over time with manageable monthly payments. The calculator determines the minimum payment the IRS will accept and compares it to what you can realistically afford based on your monthly budget.

**Currently Not Collectible (CNC)**
Temporarily suspend collection activities if you're experiencing financial hardship. The calculator analyzes whether your monthly expenses exceed your income, potentially qualifying you for CNC status.

**Penalty Abatement**
Remove or reduce penalties for reasonable cause, first-time penalty abatement, or administrative errors. Our calculator estimates potential penalty savings based on your compliance history.
