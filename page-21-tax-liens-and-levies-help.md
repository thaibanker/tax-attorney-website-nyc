## ‚ùì **URGENT LIEN & LEVY QUESTIONS - ANSWERED NOW**

### **Q: How quickly can liens and levies be released?**
**A:** Emergency levy releases can occur within 24-48 hours for hardship cases. Lien withdrawals typically take 30-45 days but credit improvement is immediate.

### **Q: Will paying off my tax debt automatically remove the lien?**
**A:** No. Liens must be formally withdrawn or discharged. Paying doesn't automatically remove the public record affecting your credit.

### **Q: Can I get seized money back from bank levies?**
**A:** Yes, if you can prove financial hardship or qualify for Currently Not Collectible status. We've returned millions in seized assets to clients.

### **Q: How much do liens hurt my credit score?**
**A:** Tax liens typically drop credit scores by 100-200 points and prevent most financing. Removal can restore scores within 30-60 days.

### **Q: Can the IRS seize my primary residence?**
**A:** Rarely, but possible. Primary residences have some protection, but the IRS can seize homes for significant tax debts with proper procedures.

### **Q: What assets can the IRS NOT seize?**
**A:** Basic clothing, unemployment benefits, certain pension income, tools of trade up to $5,000, and minimal furniture/personal effects.

### **Q: How do I prevent future liens and levies?**
**A:** Stay current on all tax obligations, make payment plan payments on time, and maintain communication with the IRS about any financial changes.
