## ‚ùì **URGENT PENALTY QUESTIONS - ANSWERED NOW**

### **Q: What's the difference between penalties and interest?**
**A:** Penalties are charges for non-compliance (failure to file, pay, etc.) and can often be removed. Interest is a charge for borrowing money from the government and is rarely abated.

### **Q: Can penalties be removed even if I was clearly at fault?**
**A:** Yes. Even when at fault, you may qualify for first-time penalty abatement, reasonable cause relief, or administrative waivers depending on circumstances.

### **Q: How much can penalty abatement save me?**
**A:** Penalty savings range from $1,000 to over $100,000 depending on your debt size. Some clients save 30-70% of their total IRS debt through penalty removal.

### **Q: What if the IRS denies my penalty abatement request?**
**A:** We have a 94% success rate on appeals. Most denials are due to insufficient documentation or wrong relief type - both correctable issues.

### **Q: Can business penalties be abated?**
**A:** Yes. Business penalties (payroll tax, estimated tax, etc.) often qualify for abatement, especially for first-time offenders or reasonable cause situations.

### **Q: How long does penalty abatement take?**
**A:** First-time abatement: 30-60 days. Reasonable cause: 60-120 days. Administrative relief: 30-90 days. Emergency cases can be expedited.

### **Q: Will penalty abatement affect my credit score?**
**A:** Penalty removal reduces your total IRS debt, which can improve your financial situation and indirectly help credit. It doesn't directly impact credit scores.
