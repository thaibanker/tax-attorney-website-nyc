## ‚ùì **URGENT PAYMENT PLAN QUESTIONS - ANSWERED NOW**

### **Q: How quickly can collections be stopped?**
**A:** Collections can be stopped within 24 hours through emergency Due Process procedures. We file immediate protective measures while your payment plan is being processed.

### **Q: What's the minimum monthly payment possible?**
**A:** Payments can be as low as $25/month for qualifying taxpayers. The IRS must accept what you can reasonably afford to pay based on necessary living expenses.

### **Q: Can I get a payment plan if I'm self-employed with irregular income?**
**A:** Yes. Self-employed taxpayers can qualify for seasonal payment plans or payments based on average monthly income. We specialize in complex business situations.

### **Q: What happens if I miss a payment?**
**A:** Missing payments can trigger default, but we provide 24/7 monitoring and can often negotiate reinstatement. Most agreements allow 1-2 missed payments before default.

### **Q: Can penalties and interest be reduced in a payment plan?**
**A:** Yes. We often negotiate penalty abatement and interest reduction as part of the installment agreement. This can save thousands in additional costs.

### **Q: How long do payment plans last?**
**A:** Individual plans can extend up to 6 years (72 months). Business plans vary based on tax type and ability to pay. We secure the longest terms possible.

### **Q: What if I can't afford even minimum payments?**
**A:** If you truly cannot afford any payment, you may qualify for "Currently Not Collectible" status or an Offer in Compromise to settle for less than owed.
