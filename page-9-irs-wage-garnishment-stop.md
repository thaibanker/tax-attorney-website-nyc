## ‚ùì URGENT IRS GARNISHMENT FAQ:

### Q: My employer just told me about an IRS garnishment. How fast can you stop it?
**A:** If we act immediately, we can often stop the garnishment before your next paycheck. Call NOW.

### Q: Can I get back the money the IRS already took from my paychecks?
**A:** In many cases, YES. We can recover garnished funds, especially if the garnishment was improper or excessive.

### Q: Will my employer fire me for having an IRS garnishment?
**A:** NO. It's illegal to terminate someone for wage garnishment. We protect your employment rights.

### Q: How much of my paycheck can the IRS really take?
**A:** The IRS can take up to 77% of your paycheck, but we can often reduce this to $0 with proper hardship filings.

### Q: I'm already behind on rent because of the garnishment. What can I do?
**A:** We can file emergency hardship claims showing you can't afford basic living expenses. This often stops garnishments immediately.
