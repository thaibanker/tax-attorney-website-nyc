## ‚ùì **URGENT AUDIT DEFENSE QUESTIONS - ANSWERED NOW**

### **Q: Should I represent myself in an IRS audit?**
**A:** Never. Self-represented taxpayers pay significantly more in additional assessments. Professional representation provides legal protection and negotiation power you don't have alone.

### **Q: What if I don't have all the records the IRS wants?**
**A:** We can reconstruct records, obtain alternative documentation, and argue legal positions when records are unavailable. Don't panic about missing records.

### **Q: How long does an IRS audit take?**
**A:** Correspondence audits: 3-6 months. Office audits: 6-12 months. Field audits: 12-24 months. Professional representation can expedite the process significantly.

### **Q: Can I negotiate with the IRS during an audit?**
**A:** Yes. Audits are negotiations, not final determinations. Experienced representation can often negotiate significant reductions in proposed assessments.

### **Q: What if I disagree with the audit results?**
**A:** You have appeal rights to IRS Appeals Division and ultimately Tax Court. Most audit disputes can be resolved favorably with proper appeals representation.

### **Q: Will an audit hurt my credit score?**
**A:** The audit itself doesn't affect credit. However, additional taxes owed can lead to liens if not properly addressed through payment plans or appeals.

### **Q: What are my rights during an IRS audit?**
**A:** You have extensive rights including professional representation, appeals process, recording meetings, and reasonable accommodations for disabilities or language barriers.
