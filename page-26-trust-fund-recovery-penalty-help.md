## ‚ùì **TRUST FUND RECOVERY PENALTY QUESTIONS - ANSWERED NOW**

### **Q: What is the Trust Fund Recovery Penalty?**
**A:** It's a penalty equal to 100% of unpaid employee withholding taxes that the IRS can assess against individuals who were responsible for paying over these taxes.

### **Q: Who can be held liable for the Trust Fund Recovery Penalty?**
**A:** Anyone who was a "responsible person" with authority to pay taxes and who "willfully" failed to pay. This can include owners, officers, directors, and sometimes employees.

### **Q: How do I know if I'm a "responsible person"?**
**A:** The IRS considers control over financial affairs, authority to direct payments, and duty to ensure tax compliance. It's not just based on job titles.

### **Q: What does "willfully" mean in TFRP cases?**
**A:** "Willfully" means voluntarily, consciously, and intentionally paying other creditors instead of taxes. It doesn't require intent to defraud.

### **Q: Can multiple people be liable for the same Trust Fund Recovery Penalty?**
**A:** Yes. The IRS can assess the penalty against multiple responsible persons, but they can only collect 100% total, not from each person.

### **Q: How long does the IRS have to assess the Trust Fund Recovery Penalty?**
**A:** Generally 3 years from the later of when the return was filed or due, but this can be extended in certain circumstances.

### **Q: Can I negotiate the Trust Fund Recovery Penalty amount?**
**A:** The penalty amount itself is fixed at 100% of the trust fund taxes, but you can challenge your liability or negotiate payment terms.
